====================

Example application to show the new message extension introduced with Eclipse Luna.

Note that this project will only work with Eclipse Luna > M5, because the latest addition makes use of the model extension to support Locale changes at runtime.
See if MLocalizable exists in your target platform to see if this project is able to work correctly.
