====================

Example application to show the new message extension introduced with Eclipse Luna.

Note that this project will only work with Eclipse Mars >= M5, because the latest changes on the message registry are added there.
Also with Mars the TranslationService.LOCALE value in the context is of type Locale and not String anymore.
